Hello! I am a computer science graduate student at UCSD. My research interests lie in Causal Representation Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am currently researching on causal representation learning in large language models at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute of UCSD.

I obtained my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option), where I am lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a> at UW Seattle. 

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy drama and theatre arts.
