Hello! I am a computer science graduate student at UCSD. My research interests lie in NLP and HCI, where I investigate the interpretability of LLM with human-centered approaches. I initialized a project to develop a causal inference text benchmark with help from <a href = "https://www.amirfeder.com/">Dr. Amir Feder</a> at Columbia University and <a href = "https://biweihuang.com/">Prof. Biwei Huang</a> at UCSD.

I obtained my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option), where I was lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a> at UW Seattle. 

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy drama and theatre arts.
