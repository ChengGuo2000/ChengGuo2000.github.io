Hello! I am a computer science graduate student at UCSD. My research interests lie in NLP and HCI, where I research improving the interpretability and reliability of LLMs. I self-initiated a project to develop a benchmark for LLM interpretability and causal inference with the help of <a href = "https://www.amirfeder.com/">Dr. Amir Feder</a> at Columbia University.

I obtained my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option), where I was lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a> at UW Seattle.
