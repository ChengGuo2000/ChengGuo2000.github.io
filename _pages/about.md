Hello! I am a computer science PhD student at CWRU. My research interests lie in causal inference, model interpretability, and concept learning. 

I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at UCSD, where I research improving the explainability and reliability of LLMs. I initiated a project to develop a text benchmark dataset for LLM interpretability and causal inference with the help of <a href = "https://www.amirfeder.com/">Dr. Amir Feder</a> at Columbia University.

I obtained my undergraduate degree at the UW, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option), where I was lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a>.
