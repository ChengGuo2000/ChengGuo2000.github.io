Hello! I am a computer science graduate student at UCSD. I obtained my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option), where I am lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a> at UW Seattle. 

My research interests lie in Algorithm & Complexity and Natural Language Processing. Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy theatre arts.
