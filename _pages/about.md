Hello! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Human-Centered Design & Engineering (Data Science option). Currently, I am lucky to work with <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/">Sourojit Ghosh</a> and <a href = "https://yunhefeng.me/">Dr. Yunhe Feng</a> at UW Seattle. 

My research interests lies in Affective Computing and Natural Language Processing. Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy theatre arts, including acting and playwriting.
